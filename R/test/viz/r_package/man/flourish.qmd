*R/flourish.R*

## flourish

## Description
 Create a graph using Flourish's API (https://developers.flourish.studio/api/introduction/). 


## Usage
```r
 
flourish( 
  chart_type = "line", 
  chart_description = NULL, 
  template_id = NULL, 
  template_version = NULL, 
  data = NULL, 
  width = NULL, 
  height = NULL, 
  ..., 
  flourish_secret_key = Sys.getenv("FLOURISH_API_KEY") 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| chart_type | Optional - a chart type string for each graph in Flourish's library. Preferred usage compared to `template_id` and `template_version`. |
| chart_description | Optional - a screen-reader description. A text alternative to the visual content that will only be visible to screen-readers, e.g. “The line chart shows China consistently higher than the other countries since 1990”. Do no replicate your title, since that will also be read by screenreaders. |
| template_id | Optional - the Flourish template ID, found at https://app.flourish.studio/@flourish. Use if you cannot use `chart_type`. |
| template_version | Optional - he template's version number. Also found at https://app.flourish.studio/@flourish. Use if you cannot use `chart_type`. |
| data | Mandatory but can be specified elsewhere - a data frame for the Flourish graph. In most cases, only one data frame is necessary. If you need to add more (e.g. in a network graph where you want to add additional node information), do so in the binding data function specific to that chart type. |
| width, height | Optional - must be a valid CSS unit (like `'100%'`, `'400px'`, `'auto'`) or a number, which will be coerced to a string and have `'px'` appended. Best left empty as Flourish can deal with this on their end. |
| ... | Any additional arguments to pass to the html widget. See `htmlwidgets` for further information. |
| flourish_secret_key | Required - our API key which can be generated within your profile account. Defaults to Sys.getenv("FLOURISH_API_KEY"). |
